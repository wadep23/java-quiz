This quiz app was created to demonstrate my abilities to select and navigate the DOM using Javascript.

The quiz begins by laying out the parameters and allowing the user to check high scores or begin the quiz.

The quiz is timed with correct answers adding to your time and incorrect answers taking time away.

The top five best scores are stored in the high score hall of fame that can be viewed at any time.

This project incorporates base HTML, CSS and javascript.
